## 描述:
You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.

You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success.

Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.      

Example 1:  
Input: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7  
Output: [4,0,3]  
Explanation:  
- 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.  
- 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.  
- 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.  
Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.  

Example 2:  
Input: spells = [3,1,2], potions = [8,5,8], success = 16  
Output: [2,0,2]  
Explanation:  
- 0th spell: 3 * [8,5,8] = [24,15,24]. 2 pairs are successful.  
- 1st spell: 1 * [8,5,8] = [8,5,8]. 0 pairs are successful.   
- 2nd spell: 2 * [8,5,8] = [16,10,16]. 2 pairs are successful.   
Thus, [2,0,2] is returned.  

Constraints:  
n == spells.length  
m == potions.length  
1 <= n, m <= 105  
1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 105  
1 <= success <= 1010

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> successfulPairs(vector<int>& spells, vector<int>& potions, long long success) {
        vector<int> pairs;
        int n = spells.size(), m = potions.size();
        sort(potions.begin(),potions.end());
        // 枚舉 spells 陣列的每個元素
        for(int i = 0;i < n;i++){
            int left = 0, right = m - 1;
            // 對 potions 陣列二分查找找第一個 spell * potion >= successful 的 potion
            while(left <= right){
                int mid = left + (right - left)/2;
                // 因 success 是 long long，故乘法前須先轉型
                if((long long)spells[i] * potions[mid] < success){
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
                else if((long long)spells[i] * potions[mid] >= success){
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
            int successful = left == m ? 0 : m - left;
            pairs.push_back(successful);
        }
        return pairs;
    }
};

時間複雜度: O((n + m)logm)，n 為 spells 長度，m 為 potions 長度。    
排序花 O(mlogm)，二分查找花 O(logm)，且 for 共做 n 次二分查找，時間為 O(nlogm)，故總時間為 O(mlogm) + O(nlogm) 
空間複雜度: O(1)
