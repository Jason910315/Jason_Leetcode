# 描述:
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
 
Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
All the integers of nums are unique.

## 解題思路:
此題陣列rotate後會有兩種可能，要使用左閉右開區間寫法
1.[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]，代表rotate最多次使其與原陣列相同  
2.[5,6,7,8,1,2,3,4]，rotate後使其變成兩個升序陣列相鄰，且後面陣列較小  
* 所以若nums[mid] < nums[right]，則新的right = mid，最小值都會位於左邊區間中，右開[left,mid)  
* nums[mid] >= nums[right]，則新的left = mid + 1，最小值是位於右邊區間，那也是左閉右開[mid + 1,right)
版本一:
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] >= nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } 
            else if(nums[mid] < nums[right]){
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[left];
    }
};
```
時間複雜度: O(logn)  
空間複雜度: O(1)
