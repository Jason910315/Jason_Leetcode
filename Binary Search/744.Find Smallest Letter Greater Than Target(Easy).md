## 描述:
You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.  

Example 1:  
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"  
Output: "c"  
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.  

Example 2:  
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"  
Output: "f"  
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.  

Example 3:  
Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"  
Output: "x"  
Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        // 找第一個 > target 的元素(相當於 >= target + 1)
        int n = letters.size();
        int l = 0, r = n - 1;
        while(l <= r){
            int mid = l + (r -l)/2;
            if(letters[mid] - 'a' < target - 'a' + 1){
                l = mid + 1;
            }
            else if(letters[mid] - 'a' >= target - 'a' + 1){
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return l == n ? letters[0] : letters[l];
    }
};
